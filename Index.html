  <h1 class=b1> Lorna Shore-To The Hellfire </h1>
 	<p class=b1>
	(I'll hold onto feeling until my final breath escapes)<br>
	(Gazing upon this world until it fades)<br>
<br><br>
	Fall with me into the other night<br>
	We can go beyond the horizon again<br>
	Fall with me until we're out of time<br>
	Let the current swallow<br>
<br><br>
	These whispers keep clawing<br>
	Your mind is dissolving light<br>
	Sink while you bathe in hallucination<br>
<br><br>
	Accept this descent into the night<br>
	Releasing your grasp to induce separation, plunged into the shadows<br>
	Lost in sensation, we're free-falling down into the ever black<br>
	Can you feel it? These pins and needles!<br>
<br><br>
	Trapped in sensation, see what you have found here<br>
	You fell into the dark<br>
	Fell into the dark<br>
<br><br>
	Release your grip and face the tide, accepting this damnation<br>
	Relinquish flesh temptation of the body and soul<br>
	The ebb and the flow, nothing confessed<br>
	Put me to rest<br>
<br><br>
	Azrael, guiding me beyond the veil<br>
	Obitual, free me from this mortal shell<br>
<br><br>
	Enter into the darkest night, I will sink where I lie<br>
	Through the sands of time, through the angel's eye<br>
<br><br>
	My final breath<br>
	Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
	Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
<br><br>
	(Whispers are) clawing!<br>
	Your mind is dissolving light<br>
	Enter the void and fall with me (with me) (with me)<br>
	Fall with me (with me)<br>
<br><br>
	Enter the void<br>
	Fall<br>
<br><br>
	Release your grip and face the tide, accepting this damnation<br>
	Relinquish flesh temptation of the body and soul<br>
	The ebb and the flow, nothing confessed<br>
	Put me to rest<br>
<br><br>
	Azrael, guiding me beyond the veil<br>
	Obitual, free me from this mortal shell<br>
<br><br>
	Enter into the darkest night, I will sink where I lie<br>
	Through the sands of time, through the angel's eye<br>
<br><br>
	My final breath<br>
	Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
	Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
	Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
<br><br>
	Sink while you bathe in hallucination<br>
<br><br>
	My final breath<br>
	Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
	As you pass through the fucking gate<br>
	Descending towards the end faster.<br>
